Welcome to my first ever attempt at coding a game using JavaScript! I appreciate you stopping by to check it out, it took me some time to develop this so I hope that you enjoy it!

You are a chicken attempting to cross the road. You must cross 4 lanes of busy traffic in order to reach your goal, if you manage to do so without being hit by a car then you get a point! If you are hit by a car, then your point total will reset.

You can move the chicken using the arrow keys on your keyboard, now go cross that road!
